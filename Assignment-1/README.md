# 🌐 Portfolio Website - CODSOFT Assignment 1

This is a responsive portfolio website created as part of **CODSOFT Internship - Web Development Task 1**.

The layout was inspired by a previous version of my portfolio (`ayush-portfolio`), but this version includes **new sections** and customizations as per the internship task requirements, such as:

- 📄 Resume Section with Download Button
- 🎯 Updated styling and responsiveness
- 📱 Mobile-friendly adjustments
